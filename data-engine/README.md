# Data Engine

This directory is reserved for failure clustering, counterfactual generation, and
LoRA training scripts.  The data engine closes the loop by analysing lowâ€‘support
answers, generating new training data, and scheduling lightweight parameter
updates for the verifier.  In this exercise the implementation is omitted.
